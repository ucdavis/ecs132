QUESTION 

(text answer - 10 pts) In our discussion of model forming in class in
connection to the library examples (one simple, one less so), a specific
application area was mentioned.  What was it?

QUESTION 

(text answer - 10 pts) In each of the applications below, state whether the
mean or median is a better measure, according to our class discussion:

   i.  Snowfall in Lake Tahoe on all January 1 days (over all years).

   ii.  The number of steps students take in traveling from Kemper Hall
   to the MU.

   iii.  Weights of a group of people entering an elevator.

Write your answers in sequence separated by comma, 
e.g. a random answer would look like "mean, median, mean"


QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer3.R'

(R code answer - 10 pts) If two independent random variables X and Y,
have expectation p and q respectively and variance r and s respectively.
Write a function vary(p,q,r,s) to compute Var( X/2 + Y) and print
vary(1,2,2,4.3)

vary <- function(p,q,r,s){
  out <-  # fill in the blank
}
print(vary(1,2,2,4.3))

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer4.R'

(R code answer - 10 pts) The third moment of a random variable X is defined
to be E(X^3).  Find the third moment of the number of dots showing in
the single roll of a die.


QUESTION  -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer5.R'

(R code answer - 10 pts) In the second library model, Sec. 3.9.2, find Var(B).

QUESTION 

(text answer - 10 pts) Let X and Y be two indicator random variables.
Write true or false for each of the statements below:

(i)   if E(XY) = 0 then E(X+Y) is less than or equal to 1
(ii)  if E(X+Y) is less than or equal to 1 then  E(XY) = 0


QUESTION

(text answer - 10 pts) Consider the bus example, Sec 2.11.  Let O_i denote
the  number getting off bus at stop i, with  O_1 = 0.  Let
T_k = O_1+...+O_k.  Which one(s) of these are true?

   (i) ET_k = EO_1+...+EO_k
   (ii) Var(T_k) = Var(O_1)+...+Var(O_k)
   (iii) EO_i has the same value for all i
   (iv) EO_i = 0.2 EL_{i-1}
   (v) none of the above is true


QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer8.R'

(R code answer - 10 pts) I and J are two indicator random variables.
If E(I+J) = 1.1 and E((I-J)^2) = 0.7, what is Var(IJ)?


QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer9.R'

(R code answer - 10 pts) Consider the board game, Sec. 2.10.  Write a
simulation code to find ET, where T is the number of turns it takes to
reach or pass 0.

Note: bonus turns (if any) don't count as extra turns

et <- function(nreps) 
{

}

set.seed(9999);
print(et(10000))
