In questions involving code which will PARTIALLY be given to you in the
question specs, you may need add new lines.  There may not be
information given as to where the lines should be inserted.

If a question includes test code, make sure to include it in your
submission

Do not answer any question with simulation code unless this is specified. 

MAKE SURE TO RUN THE CODE IN PROBLEMS INVOLVING CODE!  Hit the OMSI

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer1.R'

(Code answer.)  Give R code that computes (7.102) or (7.104).

print(                     )

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer2.R'

QUESTION 

(Text answer.)  The first argument of N() in (7.96), i.e. the sum of a_i mu_i, 
is still valid even if the X_i and Y are not normally distributed.  Give the 
number of the mailing tube that shows this.  

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer4.R'

Consider the network buffer example, Sec. 7.6.4.2.  Find a number u such that 
there is a 90% chance that the transmission is made before u milliseconds.

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer5.R'

In Sec. 7.26, write simulation code, instead of the CLT, to find the
probability that the sum will be more than 2.0 higher than it should be.
