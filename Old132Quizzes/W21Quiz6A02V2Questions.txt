QUESTION

(Text answer - 25 pts) Let X be a random variable that denotes the 
values taken by a fair dice. We can say that the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
is ______________ of X.

QUESTION

(Text answer - 25 pts)  Say we have a random sample X_i, i = 1,2,...,n, with
population cdf F_X(t).  X is a continuous random variable.  Let G denote
the empirical cdf.  Which is/are true?

(i) G(t) is a nondecreasing function.
(ii) G(t) is a nonincreasing function.
(iii) G(t) has n points of discontinuity.
(iv) G(t) is continuous.
(v) The number of points of discontinuity of G could be nonzero but a
number other than n.
(vi) G(t) is a random variable.
(vii) None of the above is true.

QUESTION

(Text answer - 25 pts)  The reason that the early pioneers of statistics
defined sample variance in the "divide by n-1" way was that dividing by
n yields a ______________ estimator of the population variance.

(R Code answer - 25 pts) Say we have a random sample X_i, i = 1,2,...,n,
with population cdf F_X(t).  Let G denote the empirical cdf.  Suppose
(unknown to the one analyzing the data), X has a uniform distribution on
[40,60].  Find Var[G(48.8)].
