QUESTION

(text answer - 20 pts) In our book, instead of set union we say
_______________________.


QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer2.R'

(R code answer - 20 pts) We choose two letters from the word READING
without replacement. What is the probability that we draw an N and then
a G?

QUESTION

(text answer - 20 pts) Consider the Preferential Attachment Model, Sec.
2.13.1.  Let D_{i,j} denote the degree of node v_{i} immediately after
node v_{j} attaches to the network.  Define the events A = {D_{1,3} = 2}
and B = {N_3 = 2}.  Are A and B disjoint?  Are they independent?  Answer
D for disjoint only, I for independent only, B for both, and N for
neither.


QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer4.R'

(R code answer - 20 pts)  Consider the bus problem, Sec. 2.11 (page 20).  
Find the probability that in the first 2 stops, a total of exactly 3 passengers board.


QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer5.R'

(R code answer - 20 pts) In Sec. 2.14.6, we used runif() to simulate one
toss of a coin.  We could instead use sample() for this, filling in the
blanks below, in code that finds the approximate value of probability of
getting 2 heads in 2 tosses:

count <- 0
for (i in 1:nreps) {
   toss1 <- sample(          )
   toss2 <- sample(          )
   if (   ) count <- count + 1
}
print(count/nreps)
