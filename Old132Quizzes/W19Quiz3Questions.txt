Students:  Please keep in mind the OMSI rules.  Save your files often,
make sure OMSI fills your entire screen at all times, etc.  Remember
that clicking CopyQtoA will copy the entire question box to the answer
box.

In questions involving code which will PARTIALLY be given to you in the
question specs, you may need add new lines.  There may not be
information given as to where the lines should be inserted.

If a question includes test code, make sure to include it in your
submission

Do not answer any question with simulation code unless this is specified. 

MAKE SURE TO RUN THE CODE IN PROBLEMS INVOLVING CODE!  Hit the OMSI

QUESTION 

(Text answer.) State the number of the mailing tube used in (3.58).

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer2.R'

(Code answer.) You roll a blue jjjdie and a yellow die, yielding numbers of
dots X and Y.  You win $1 for each blue dot and $2 for each yellow dot.
Let W denote how much you win.  Find P(W = 6).

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer3.R'

(Code answer.)  In Problem 2, let Z be the indicator variable for the
event W = 6.  Find Var(Z).

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer4.R'

(Code answer.) Modify the simulation code in p.62 so that it returns
(the approximate value of) EB.  The original code is given below.

libsim <- function(nreps) {
   prt <- sample(c(4,5,6,7),nreps,replace=T,prob=c(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4))
   i <- sample(c(0,1),nreps,replace=T)
   b <- prt + 2*i
   x <- cbind(prt,i,b)
   bgt4 <- x[b > 4,]
   mean(bgt4[,3] == 6)
}

print(libsim(10000))  # don't forget to print!

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer6.R'

(Code answer.) Say we toss a coin 12 times, resulting in an H,T pattern,
e.g. HHTHTHTTHHTH.  Let X denote the number of instances of HTH, e.g.
three in HHTHTHTT.  Find and print EX For full credit, you must use
indicator variables.
