(R Code Answer - 20 Points) Consider the random variables N(t) in Sec. 8.1.
Suppose the X_i have a U(0,1) distribution, not exponential.  Find
P{N(t) = 0).

nt0 <- function(t)  # t can be any pos. number
{


}

print(nt0(0.6))
print(nt0(1.6))

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer5.R'

(R code answer - 20 Points)  The hazard function for a random variable X is
defined to be f_X(t) / [1 - F_X(t)].  Write code for this for the
density 2t, 0 < t < 1.

haz <- function(t)
{


}

print(haz(0.5))
