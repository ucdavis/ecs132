QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer1.R'

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer3.R'

(R code answer, 25 pts.)  A bank opens at 10 a.m., and N customers
arrive in the next 15 minutes, where N has a Poisson distribution with
mean 4.2.  The first 3 customers, if any, will get an ice cream coupon
worth $4; the next 2, if any, will receive a $1 coupon. Find the
expected total payout T.  E.g. if just 2 customers come in, T = 2 X 4 =
8, while if 5 come in, T = 3 X 4 + 2 X 1 = 14.

print(              )

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer4.R'

(R code answer, 25 pts.)  Consider the inventory model, p.117, with
v = 0.6, w = 0.4 and r = 5.  Find the long-run average amount of stock,
measured at the start of each day.
