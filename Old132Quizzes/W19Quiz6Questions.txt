(Code answer.) Suppose X has an exponential distribution with parameter
1.0, i.e. its density is exp(-t) for t > 0 and 0 otherwise.  Calculate
and print E(X^6).

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer4.R'

(Code answer.)  Write a function that will calculate EN_{it} in (6.4).
Here P is the transition matrix.  States are numbered 1,2,...

calcENit <- function(P,i,t) 
{

}

m <- rbind(c(0.25,0.25,0.50),c(1/3,1/3,1/3),c(0.6,0.4,0))
print(calcENit(m,2,3))
