Students:  Please keep in mind the OMSI rules.  Save your files often,
make sure OMSI fills your entire screen at all times, etc.  Remember
that clicking CopyQtoA will copy the entire question box to the answer
box.

In questions involving code which will PARTIALLY be given to you in the
question specs, you may need add new lines.  There may not be
information given as to where the lines should be inserted.

If a question includes test code, make sure to include it in your
submission

Do not answer any question with simulation code unless this is specified. 

MAKE SURE TO RUN THE CODE IN PROBLEMS INVOLVING CODE!  Hit the OMSI
Submit and Run button.

QUESTION 

(Text answer.) State the number of the mailing tube used in (4.8).

QUESTION

(Text answer.) Consider the simulation in Sec. 4.2.2.  Suppose we only
wish to compute Var(N).  Then actually we need not add 1 in line 3.
State the number of the mailing tube that justifies this.

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer3.R'

(Code answer.) In the parking space example, say you win $1 if D = 1, 0
otherwise.  Let W denote your prize.  Find Var(W).  You may make use of
numbers in the book.

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer4.R'

(Code answer.)  Consider the parking space example.  Use simulation to
find P(park in first block | D = 3).

sim3 <- function(nreps) 
{

}

print(sim3(10000))

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer5.R'

(Code answer.)  Suppose M has a geometric distribution with success
probability p.  Write a function that returns P( M <= k | M <= r) where k
and r are positive integers with k <= r.  For full credit, your code
must use only elementary R arithmetic operations, i.e. not use the
*geom() functions, and must be loop-free.

probkr <- function(p,k,r) 
{

}

print(probkr(0.6,5,8))
