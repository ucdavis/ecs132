QUESTION

(Text answer - 25 pts)  The R functions plot(), print() and summary() are
examples of _________________ functions.


QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer2.R'

(R code answer - 25 pts)  Consider the toy example, p.209.  Let T = X_1 X_2.
Find ET.  (Note:  There is a short cut.)



QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer3.R'

(R code answer - 25 pts)  Say we have a random sample, X_i, i = 1,2,...,n
from some population in which X has unknown density f_X.  We are
interested in the population mean mu, and will use W = the sample mean
("X-bar") as our estimator.  Then |W - mu| is our estimation error, and
we may be interested in E(|W - mu|).  Use simulation to evaluate that in
the case of f_X being an exponential distribution with mean 2.0.

sim <- function(n,nreps) {
 

}

print(sim(1000,10000))


QUESTION  -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer4.R'

(R code answer - 25 pts)  Write a function that does k-Nearest Neighbor
prediction for a single predictor.

[KNN functions from stat/ML libraries are NOT allowed. You MAY use sort() or order() if you wish]

kNear <- function(x,y,k,newx)  # x,y are vector, newx a "scalar"
{ 


   predValue <- 
   return(predValue)
}

x <- c(5,12,13,8.88)
y <- c(22,11,5.5,12.12)
newx <- 13.2)
print(kNear(x,y,3,newx)
