Students:  Please keep in mind the OMSI rules.  Save your files often,
make sure OMSI fills your entire screen at all times, etc.  Remember
that clicking CopyQtoA will copy the entire question box to the answer
box.

In questions involving code which will PARTIALLY be given to you in the
question specs, you may need add new lines.  There may not be
information given as to where the lines should be inserted.

If a question includes test code, make sure to include it in your
submission.

Do not answer any question with simulation code unless this is specified. 

MAKE SURE TO RUN THE CODE IN PROBLEMS INVOLVING CODE!  Hit the OMSI

QUESTION 

(Text answer, 25 points.)  Suppose a quiz problem involves the
geometric distribution family.  Say a student uses integrate().  What's
wrong here?

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer2.R'

(R code answer, 25 points.)  Say X has a normal distribution with
mean 10 and variance 4.  I'd like to find the probabilities P(X > b) for
b = 8.5, 11.1 and 12.6.  Do this with a single function call.

print(  (   ))

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer3.R'

(R code answer, 50 points.)  Two people each toss a different coin n times, 
the first one with probability of head 0.3 and the second one with 0.6, 
resulting in U and V heads, respectively.  Let W = U+V.  The distribution of W
depends on n, so this defines a 1-parameter family of distributions, for
which one could write d/p/q/r functions.  Here you will write d and r.

dw <- function(x,n)  # write this for scalar x only, not vector
{  tot <- 0
   for (i in 0:x) {
      tot <- tot + 
   }

}

rw <- function(nw,n) 
{  u <-
   v <-

}

print(dw(8,5))
print(mean(rw(10000,5)^2))
