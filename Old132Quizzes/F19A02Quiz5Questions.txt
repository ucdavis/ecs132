In questions involving code which will PARTIALLY be given to you in the
question specs, you may need add new lines.  There may not be
information given as to where the lines should be inserted.

If a question includes test code, make sure to include it in your
submission.

Do not answer any question with simulation code unless this is specified.

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer1.R'

(R code answer, 25 pts.) In the example on p.130, find P(X < 1.6).

print(           )

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer2.R'

(R code answer, 25 pts.) In the example on p.33, let M be the number
of kings drawn.  Find F_M(2.2).

print(           )

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer3.R'

(R code answer, 25 pts.)  A vendor guarantees a certain product for 6
months.  We treat the lifetime L in months of the product as a discrete 
random variable taking on the values 1,2,3,...  If L <= 2, the vendor 
refunds the purchaser $5.  If 2 < L <= 6, the vendor gives a refund of $1.  
Find the expected payout (per purchaser).  Assume the lifetime of the product
has a geometric distribution with p = 0.25, so that P(L = 3) = 0.75^2 0.25.

print(           )

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript omsi_answer4.R'

(R code answer, 25 pts.)  Write a function q(v) to compute the
inverse of F_X on p.130, for 0 < v < 1. 

q <- function(v) 
{


}

print(q(0.36))
