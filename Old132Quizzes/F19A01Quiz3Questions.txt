1.  (R code answer, 25 pts.) In the bus ridership example, find
p_{B_1}(1), i.e. the probability mass function of B_1 evaluated at 1.

print(     )

2.  (R code answer, 25 pts.) In the bus ridership example, state the
support of L_2,  giving your answer as an R vector.

print(     )

3.  (R code answer, 25 pts.) In the parking space example, Jill tells
you she parked in the second block.  Find the probability that she is in
the first space of that block, i.e. right at the destination.

print(     )

4.  (R code answer, 25 pts.) Write simulation code to find Cov(L_1,L_2)
in the bus ridership problem.  For your convenience, the code from p.30
is included below; modify as needed.  BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR CODE PRINT
OUT THE ANSWER.

nreps <- 10000
nstops <- 10
count <- 0
for (i in 1:nreps) {
   passengers <- 0
   for (j in 1:nstops) {
      if (passengers > 0)
         for (k in 1:passengers)
            if (runif(1) < 0.2)
               passengers <- passengers - 1
      newpass <- sample(0:2,1,prob=c(0.5,0.4,0.1))
      passengers <- passengers + newpass
   }
   if (passengers == 0) count <- count + 1
}
print(count/nreps)
