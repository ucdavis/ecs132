1. Histogram.  As explained in class, the key to making this museum
demostration work is that the number of balls in each bin is basically a
bin count as in a histogram.

2.  The TA changed the question during the quiz.  It was originally
asking for P(N >= 30 | N >= 25), but it became P(N >= 30).

The former is 

(1 - ppois(29,28.8))/ (1 - ppois(24,28.8))

while the latter is

1 - ppois(29,28.8)

3.  For G(2/3), find c such that P(Xbar <= c) = 2/3.  By adding the
probabilities, c = 70.5.
