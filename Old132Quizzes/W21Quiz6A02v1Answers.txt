1.  the support

2.  (i), (iii), (vi)

3.  biased

4.  G(48.8) is N, the number of X_i that are <= 48.8, divided by n.  N
has a binomial distribution, with n trials and p = F_X(48.8) = 
(48.8-40) / (60-40) = 0.44.  We know that since N is binomial
Var(N) = np(1-p).  Thus Var(N/n) = p(1-p)/n.

0.44 * (1-0.44) / n
