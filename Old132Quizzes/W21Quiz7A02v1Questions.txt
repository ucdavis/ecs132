QUESTION

(Text answer 25 Points) For fixed data and H_0, the more stringent the
test, the __________________ the associated confidence interval.

QUESTION

(Text answer 25 Points) Say we do predict(qeLin(mlb,'Weight')).  Name the
function called by predict(). 

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer3.R'

(R code answer 25 Points) In the mlb data, predict weight from height (no other
predictors), fitting a quadratic model with no holdout set.  Find the
predicted weight of a player of height 77.2.  Show your full code.

library(regtools)


print(  )

QUESTION -ext .R -run 'Rscript ./omsi_answer4.R'

(R code answer 25 Points) Say we have a random sample, X_i,
i = 1,2,...,n from some population in which X has unknown density f_X.
We compute the sample variance s^2 (using the 1/n definition, not
1/(n-1).) We are interested in Es.  Use simulation to evaluate that in
the case of f_X being an exponential distribution with mean 2.0.

sim <- function(n,nreps) {


}

print(sim(1000,10000))
