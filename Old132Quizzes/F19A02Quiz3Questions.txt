QUESTION 

(Text answer, 25 pts.) Jack and Jill each toss a fair coin 10 times,
resulting in X and Y heads, respectively.  Let W = X - Y. Name the parametric
distribution family, if any, that W's distribution belongs to; if none,
answer None.

(R code answer, 25 pts.) Consider the setting of Problem 1, but in
which each person tosses the coin n times.  Write a function g(n,k) that
finds the probability that X and Y differ by at most k. 

g <- function(n,k) 
{



}

print(g(10,3))

(R code answer, 25 pts.) The skewness of the distribution of a
random variable X, a measure of asymmetry, is defined to be

E[{(X - mu)/sigma}^3]

where mu and sigma are the mean and standard deviation of X, respectively.
Write a function sk(n,p) that calculates the skewness of a random
variable having a binomial distribution with parameters n and p.

sk <- function(n,p) 
{
   


}

print(sk(10,0.3))

(R code answer, 25 pts.) Consider the parking space example, p.76.  Let B
denote the number of the block we end up parking in.  E.g. if we park in
the second block, B = 2.  Find EB.

print(        )
