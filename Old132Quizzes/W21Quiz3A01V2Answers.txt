Let S denote the amount of time the patron holds the book, and let I be 
the indicator random variable for returning to a foreign branch.        
Then
   
B = S + 2I
                                                                                             Var(S)
= E(S^2) - (ES)^2
ES = (0.1) 4 + (0.2) 5 + (0.3) 6 + (0.4) 7
E(S^2) = (0.1) 4^2 + (0.2) 5^2 + (0.3) 6^2 + (0.4) 7^2
Var(S) = 1
                                                                                             Var(B)
= Var(S) + 4 * Var(I)
Var(I) =  0.5(1-0.5)
Var(B) = 1 + 1 = 2

6.  The key point is that X and Y take on only the values 1 and 0.  So:

If E(XY) = 0, that means that whenever X = 1 then Y = 0 and vice versa.
In other words, Y = 1 - X.  So, E(X+Y) = 1.

On the other hand, suppose E(X+Y) <= 1.  That means p + q <= 1, where p
and q are the success probabilities of X and Y, respectively.  There are
lots of counterexamples to show E(XY) is not necesarily 0.  E.g. Y = X,
with p <= 0.5.

7. Choices (i) and (iv) are true.  Choice (i) comes directly from a
mailing tube, but what about (iv)?  It's pretty subtle.

Consider stop i and O_i, for a fixed value of i.  The bus arrives with
L_i passengers, among which O_i alight.  Say for instance L_{i-1} is 5.
Given that the number of those 5 passengers who alight will have a
binomial distribution with n = 5 and p = 0.2.  Its mean will be np =
1.0.  

In the notebook, have an L_{i-1} column and an O_i column all the lines
of the notebook in which L_{i-1} is 5, the average number alighting will
be 1.0.  Similarly, in all the lines of the notebook in which L_{i-1} is
12, say, the average number alighting will 12 (0.2) = 2.4.

Now reorder the lines in the notebook, first with all the having having
L_{i-1} = 0, then with all the having having L_{i-1} = 1, then with all
the having having L_{i-1} = 2, and so on.  In each group of lines, the
long-run average value of O_i will be 0.2 times the L_{i-1} value.  So
among all the notebook lines, the long-run average of O_i will be 0.2
times the L_{i-1} column.  This gives us (iv).

8.  Let p and q denote the success probabilities of I and J.  We have

1.1 = E(I+J) = EI + EJ = p + q

and

0.7 = E[(I-J)^2] = E(I^2) - 2E(IJ) + E(J^2)

Since I^2 = I and J^2 = J, that means

0.7 = p - 2 E(IJ) + q = 1.1 - 2E(IJ)

Thus

E(IJ) = 0.2

Now, note that IJ is itself an indicator random variable, as it takes on
only the values 0 and 1.  Its success probability is

P(IJ = 1) = E(IJ) = 0.2

By the mailing tube for indicator variables, we then have

Var(IJ) = 0.2 (1 - 0.2)
