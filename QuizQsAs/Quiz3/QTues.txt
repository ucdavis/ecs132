1.  (Text answer, 25 points) List all examples below in which the stated
pair of random variables is independent.  Sample answer: (a), (b), (d).

a.  v4 and v3 in the Pref. Attach Model

b.  B1 and B2 in the bus model

c.  X1 and X3 in the ALOHA model

d.  lengths of the smallest and largest pieces in the broken
    rod model

e.  C and A in the Monty Hall problem

f.  R and B in the board game

2.  (R code answer, 25 points) Find E(X1) in the ALOHA model.  Feel free
to cite numbers already derived in the book, rather than rederiving
them.

3.  (R code answerr, 25 points) Write a function with call form evalg(p,g)
to find E[g(X)], where p is a vector consisting of the P(X = i), i =
1,2,...  (range of i assumed finite).  For full credit, use no loops.
Fill in the blanks:

evalg <- function(p,g) 
{



}

# expected value of the square root of X, where X = dots in 1 roll of die
evalg(rep(1/6,6),sqrt)  

4.  (R code answer, 25 points) Consider the example of Coins A, B and C
following Eqn. (3.80).  Let U = X + Y and V = Y + Z.  Find Cov(U,V),
using the "handy shortcut" Eqn. (3.72).
