1.  (Text answer,  points)  In order to arrange for hist() to be a
density estimator, we need to set a certain argument.  State which
argument this is, and why this is necessary.

2.  (R code answer,  points)  We saw in our stat tutorial that S^2 is
slightly biased, with the amount of bias being -1/n sigma^2.  Later, we
found the MM estimator of lambda in a gamma distribution to be Abar/S^2.
It too is biased.  Use simulation to determine the amount of bias.  Fill
in the blanks.  (We use "cpar" here instead of "c", in order to avoid
confusion with the R function c().

biasAmtGamma <- function(lambda,cpar,n,nreps)) 
{

   for (i in 1:nreps) {

      x <- rgamma(   )
      Abar <- 
      S2 <- 

   }

}

print(biasAmtGamma(2,3.5,10,1000))  # about 0.78, but much smaller for n=100

3.  Say we have a sample from a population in which X is assumed to have
a uniform distribution on (q,r), with q and r unknown.  (Note:  This is
not the same q as in the above problem.)  Find the Method of Moments
estimators of q and r.  Fill in the blanks.  You must show your work in
comments.  You will probably make use of the fact that Abar is between q
and r.

mmUnif <- function(x) 
{

   return(list(qMM = , rMM = ))

}

x <- runif(100,2,6)
print(mmUnif(x)) 

4.  (R code answer,  points)  Say we wish to find an approximate
confidence interval for F_X(t), with confidence level ciLevel.  (To get
most of the credit, you may assume ciLevel = 0.95.) Return the interval
as a 2-element vector.  Fill in the blanks.

FXci <- function(x,t,ciLevel=0.95) 
{

}

print(FXci(Nile,1202.4,0.95))
print(FXci(Nile,1202.4,0.80))
