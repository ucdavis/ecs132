1.  (Text answer, 20 points.)  List all the R functions that are called in
the line of code

f <- function(x) x[1:3] == x[1] + x[2]

2.  (R code answer, 40 points.)  We have tags numbered 1 through m. We
choose k of them at random without replacement. Write a function simTags()
that computes the approximate expected value of the largest minus the
smallest of the k tags we choose, using simulation.  Fill in the blanks.

simTags <- function(m,k,nreps) 
{

}

print(simTags(10,3,100))

3.  (R code answer, 40 points.) Write a function with call form
upsProp(v) that will work as follows.  The vector v consists only of 0s
and 1s, and we are interested in 0-to-1 transitions.  E.g. in 0111001001
there are 3 such transitions.  The function will compute the proportion
of such transitions.  For full credit, do not use any loops.  Fill in
the blanks:

upsProp <- function(v) 
{



}

print(upsProp(c(0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1))  # prints 1/3 (3/9)
