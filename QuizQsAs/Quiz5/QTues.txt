1. (R code answer, 25 points.)  Consider the Markov chain whose transition
matrix is Eqn. (5.2).  Evaluate the expression I-P'.  Fill in the
blanks.

   P <- rbind(c(0.5,0,0.5),c(0.25,0.5,0.25),c(1,0,0))


   print(iMinusPprime)

2. (R code answer, 25 points.)  Consider the Markov chain whose transition
matrix is Eqn. (5.2).  Say we definitely start at state 3, i.e. X_0 = 3
w.p. 1.  Find and PRINT the value of E(X_1 X_2).


print(                           )

3.  (R code answer, 25 points.)  We say that the "holding time" at any
state i in a Markov chain is the number of time periods until we leave i.
For instance say we are at state 8 and then go to 8 again, then 8 again,
then to 2.  Then T_8 = 3.  Note that any T_i will have a geometric
distribution.  Consider the Markov chain whose transition matrix is Eqn.
(5.2).  Find Var(T_2).


   print(            )

4.  (R code answer, 25 points.)  Say I currently have 2 consecutive heads
in the 3-Heads game.  Find the probability that I'll also have 2
consecutive heads after 5 more flips of the coin.  Fill in the blanks
below.  (Remember, 2 straight heads is state 3, not 2.)

   p <- matrix(rep(0,9),nrow=3)
   p[1,1] <- 0.5
   p[1,2] <- 0.5
   p[2,3] <- 0.5
   p[2,1] <- 0.5
   p[3,1] <- 1

   I <-             # 3x3 identity matrix
   tmp <- I
   for (i in 1:5) {
   }

   probAt2Again <- 
   print(probAt2Again)
