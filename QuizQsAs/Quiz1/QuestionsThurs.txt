1. (Text answer, 30 points.) In the ALOHA network example, which of
these would be 0?

(i) P(X1 = 2)

(ii) P(X2 = 2)

(iii) P(X1 = X2)

(iv) P((X2 = 2 | X1 = 0)

(v) P((X1 = 2 | X2 = 0) 

Just list your (zero or more) choices, no explanation.

2. (R code answer, 35 points.) Consider the board game example, Sec.
2.10.  Write code that finds and PRINTS P(the player ends up at square 5
at the end of his first turn).  Recall that his first turn may include a
bonus roll.  Show your work, in comments.

3. (R code answer, 35 points.) We have tags in a box, labeled 1,2,...,r.
We keep choosing them at random, WITH replacement, until we get a sum of
m or more.  Write simulation code to find the probability that it takes
us s turns to reach this goal.  Fill in the blanks:

chooseTags <- function(r,m,s,nreps) 
{
   count <- 0
   for (i in 1:nreps) {
      sumTags <- 0
      nTurns <- 0
      while(1) {


      }

   }

   return(        )

}

print(chooseTags(5,8,3))
