1. (Text answer, 25 points.) For each pair of random variables below,
write "independent" or "not independent."

a. M and G1 in the committee example, Sec. 3.9.3

b. W and G1 in the committee example

c. B1 and B2, p.78

d. D and N in the parking space example, Sec. 4.2.2

2. (R code answer, 25 points.) In the committee example, find E(G1 G2).

print(                   )

3. (R code answer, 25 points.)  Use the function dbinom() to evaluate 
Equation (4.32).

print(dbinom(                     ))

4. (R code answer, 25 points.) In the parking space example, suppose we
are told by someone watching the neighborhood that the second open space
is in 13th space, i.e. space 3 of the second block.  Find the probability
that that first open space is space 6 in the first block.
