1. (Text answer, 35 points.) For each pair of random variables below,
write "independent" or "not independent."

a. G1 and G2+G3 in the committee example, Sec. 3.9.3

b. N5 and N8 in the Preferential Attachment Model

c. B1 and B2, p.78

d. S1 and S2-S1, where S1 and S2, are the locations of the first and
second open spaces in the parking space example

2.  (Text answer, 15 points.) Fill in the blank:  The family of negative
binomial distributions is a generalization of __________________.

3.  (Text answer, 15 points.) In the derivations of the mean and
variance of the binomial family, what assumption did we make use of for the
variance that we did not need for the mean?

4. (R code answer, 35 points.) Consider the parking space example.
Suppose now there are two possible destinations, at the beginning and
end of the second block, each equally desirable.  The driver will still
take the first open space as before, but in this new model, she will
walk to whichever destination is closer to her parking place.  Use
simulation to find the probability that she ends up walking to the
destination at the beginning of that second block.  Alter the original
code, but you must use rgeom().

parksim <- function (nreps) {
   nvals <- rgeom(nreps ,0.15) + 1
   dvals <- ifelse (nvals <= 10,11-nvals,nvals-11)
   mean(dvals)
}

print(parksim(1000)
