1. (R code answer,  30 points) Say sticks come in various sizes.  Let L
denote the length of a stick.  Suppose it's measured with some amount of
independent error R, so the observed length is O = L + R.  Suppose L has an
exponential distribution with mean 50.0, and R is normal with mean 0 and
variance 1.6.  Find Var(O).

2. (R code answer, 30 points) A light bulb manufacturer is trying to
determine a good time for its guarantee. They will guarantee that a bulb
will last at least w amount of time, and will give a refund otherwise.
Say the lifetime of light bulbs is exponential with mean 100 hours.  If
they take w = 150 hours, what proportion of bulbs will result in refunds?

3. (R code answer, 20 points) Consider a random walk on 1,2,...,w.  From
any state i=2,...,w-1 we go to i-1 or i+1 with probability p and 1-p.
From 1 and w we go to 2 and w-1 respectively.  Say X_0 = 1.  X_2 has a
parametric distribution with parameters p and w.  Let's call it the "pw
family."  It will have "d,p,q,r" functions.  Find d().  Fill in the
blanks.  Assume w >= 4.  You need not account for values of i outside
the support of X_2.

dpw <- function(i,p,w) 
{

}

print(dpw(1,0.75,5))

4. (R code answer, 20 points) Consider a parametric family of densities
defined on 0 to 1, with density r t^{r-1}.  The parameter r can be any
value greater than 1.  Find the q function.  Fill in the blanks.

q <- function(r,u) 
{

}

print(q(1.5,0.2))
