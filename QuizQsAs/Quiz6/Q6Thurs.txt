1.  (Text answer, 30 points)  Fill in the blank:  The formal name of the
analog of density functions for discrete distributions is
___________________________.

2.  (R code answer, 25 points)  Say X is the number of dots in one roll of
a fair die.  Write a function with call form dotsF(t) that finds and
returns the cdf F_X(t), for any t between -infinity and infinity,
exclusive.

dotsF <- function(t) 
{

}

print(c(dotsF(-1), dotsF(2), dotsF(3.3), dotsF(6.6))

3.  (R code answer, 25 points)  Suppose light bulb lifetimes are
exponentially distributed with mean m hours.  Say we have a pack of b
bulbs, and we are interested in the number of them N that last for more
than h hours.  The distribution of N is a parametric family, which we'll
call bulbLife, with parameters m, b and h.  Thus one could write
"d,p,q,r" functions for it.  Write the r function.

rbulbLife <- function(n,m,b,h)

{



}

print(mean(rbulbLife(1000,100,6,120))

4.  (R code answer, 20 points)  Say in the 3-Heads game, there is a prize
of $2 every time we reach state 2, i.e. 2 consecutive heads, and a prize
of $3 whenever we obtain 3 consecutive heads.  Find the long-run average
winnings for a player per play of the game.

print(                   )
