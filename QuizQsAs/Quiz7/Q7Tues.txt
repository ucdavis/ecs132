1.  (Text answer, 35 points) Say the variable X has an exponential
distribution in some population, with lambda = 10.  We take a sample of
size 8.  Viewing this from the "notebook" perspective, we would have
columns X1, X2,..., X8.  Say we were to do this 100 times.  If we were
to draw a histogram of the numbers in the X2 column, which one of the
following would it likely look like, roughly?

a.  An exponential shape.

b.  A bell shape.  

c.  Flat.
                                                                                d.  None of the above. 

2.  (Text answer, 25 points)  Say we have some estimator T of some
population value theta, based on sample data.  There is a quantity (a
single number, not a pair of numbers or a vector) used as a measure of
the accurcy of T.  What is the name of this quantity?

3.  (Text answer, 20  points) Consider the museum demonstration of the
Central Limit Theorem, presented in class.  Which one of these would be
the most helpful in producing a more accurate bell shape? 

a. more rows of pins

b. more marbles 

c. more pins per row

d. taller collector bins

e. having many colors of marbles

f. none of the above

4.  (R code answer, 20  points) Say the variable X has a beta distribution
in some population, with alpha = 1 and beta = 2.  We compute S^2.  What
value would this come out to be, approximately?
