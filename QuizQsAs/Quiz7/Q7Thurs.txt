1.  (Text answer, 35 points)  The R hist() function produces a rather
choppy graph.  What R function for the same purpose produces a smooth
graph?

2.  (R code answer, 25  points)  Find S^2 (not s^2) for the Nile data
built-in to R.

3.  (R code answer, 20 points)  In Nile data, estimate F_X(1129.2).


print(                              )

4.  (R code answer, 20 points)  Write a function with call form
betaSim(alpha,beta,n,d,nreps) that uses simulation to find 
P(Xbar > d), where Xbar is the sample mean in a sample of size n from a
beta distribution with parameters alpha and beta.

betaSim <- function(alpha,beta,n,d,nreps) 
{

   for (i in ) {
      x <- 
      
   }

   countXbarD/  
}

print(betaSim(2,1,5,0.72,1000))  # should be about 0.32
