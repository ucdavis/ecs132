Each marble goes through r rows of pegs, making r left/right turns.
It's final bin number will be determined by the number of left turns (say
the bins are numbered 0,1,2,..., starting on the left).  

The number of left turns is a binomially distributed random variable
with r trials and success probability 0.5.  It is thus a sum of r random
variables, each being 1 (left turn) or 0 (right turn).

The CLT says that the distribution of a sum becomes more and more normal
as the number of terms goes to infinity.  In this example, the number of
terms is r, the number of rows.

4. S^2 will approximately be the variance of this random variable.

alpha <- 1 
beta <- 2
num <- alpha * beta
tmp <- alpha + beta
den <- (tmp^2) * (tmp+1)
print(num/den)  # 0.05555556
