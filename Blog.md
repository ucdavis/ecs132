**Spring 2023**

**April 7, 0955:**

We will not have a quiz next week.  Instead, Dylan and Lan will give a mini-lecture. Of course any such presentation could be the subject of quiz questions.

**April 7, 0945:**

I've pushed the [full version of our textbook](https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/edit/master/FullProbStatBook.pdf) to our class repo here. It is NOT required that you read it, but it is there in case you wish to read more about some topic. Also, our official version contains '?' symbols, which are references to material that is in the full book but not in our version.

My [op-ed](https://tinyurl.com/yc8cduej) on ChatGPT and statistics is now out. You may find it interesting.

Can you answer this question: "How does a computer boot up?" Most CS students can't. And when I mention that to non-CS people, they are shocked that such a basic thing would be foreign to budding computer experts.

It's not your fault. This topic should, IMO, be taught in ECS 50 and/or 150, and usually is not, I believe. But yes, it is indeed a basic thing, something very important to know, as are "systems" issues in general. In the last day or so, for example, I've encountered several students whose trouble with OMSI seems to be related to lack of knowledge of environment variables such as PATH, knowledge that is taken for granted in real-world software development. It is not enough to just know how to code. Nor is it enough to ace the PATH questions on the ECS 36B final exam but then erase the material from your brain after the exam.

Please see my [ECS 189G blog post](https://github.com/ucdavis/FairMLCourse/blob/main/Blog.md) of 17:35, re seeking help, the Unix **script** command, etc.

I mentioned in class today that anyone who considers him/herself to be well versed with computers should know something about client/server programming. If you haven't done this kind of coding before, I urge you to read [my tutorial](https://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/matloff/public_html/Python/PyNet.pdf). You will NOT need this for our class, just something to back up your future claims of expertise. :-) And by the way, it will help you understand OMSI better.

Someone brought up the perennial R-vs.-PYthon-for-data-science issue in both of my classes today. In the afternoon class, I made a comment about random forests, which I will elaborate on below, but first I should make one point clear: Our course is not an R-in-probability-and-statistics class; it's a probability-and-statistics class, period. The emphasis is on the concepts and methods, not on the language. Keep in mind always: this is a MATH class.

At any rate, I mentioned in the afternoon class that IMO there are better libraries for random forests in R than in Python. In case anyone is curious, I would cite e.g. the grf package by the Stanford Econ and Stat people. The linear interpolation capability is especially important.

But again, though the grf package was developed in R (I think there is now a Python version, though not in sklearn), this was not because R is a "better" language but because Stat people tend to use R.

All my old ECS 132 quizzes are available [here](https://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/OldECS132Quizzes).

We will soon be forming our Homework Groups. Group size is 3 or 4. If you have 1 to 3 people you would like to be in a Group with, please so inform Lan Jiang (lanjiang@ucdavis.edu) by Friday, April 7, 11:59 pm (even if you are in Dylan's section). Otherwise, Lan will assign you to a group.

Details of how the Groups work are in the [general course info doc](https://github.com/matloff/nmGeneralCourseInfo/blob/master/RulesAndProcedures.md). Note carefully that this document is vital to your success in the course, regarding homework, exams, grading and so on; please read it right away.

My earlier e-mail messages said our blog was on the machine Heather. Of course, that is incorect. The blog is the GitHub file you are now reading.

**April 3, 2048:**

Our [course syllabus](https://github.com/ucdavis/ecs132/blob/master/Syllabus.md) is now ready!

**April 3, 2015:**

It may be a couple of days before we have days/times/locations for office hours. For now, if you have questions about Quiz 0, please e-mail NM on quiz content matters, or your assigned TA (see Syllabus, available later this evening) on OMSI issues.

All class announcements from this point onward will be made here in this
blog, rather than by mass e-mail.  When making a blog post, I will also
try to send a message notifying you of a new post, but may not always do
so.  You are required to read the blog at least once per day.
